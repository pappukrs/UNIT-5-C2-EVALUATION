# UNIT-5-C2-EVALUATION
Please note: It is mandatory to use ES6 syntax and try -catch block with async await
Problem Statement :-
Go to https://openweathermap.org/api
Create and verify your account to get the API key.
Design an input box to get the value of a city.
Make a GET request using fetch and async-await to get the response.
You have to show the following data in your app from the response you have got. (temp, pressure, humidity, wind speed, sunrise, sunset, weather description)
The above mentioned fields are mandatory, you may use extra fields as well to make the card more descriptive
If the weather description is ‘clear sky’, show the icon of sun, else show the icon of clouds.
For UI, you are free to refer to other weather websites to see how they display the data.
Avoid keeping it only HTML, add some CSS to make it look like an actual app that users can use.
Find API Link here (https://openweathermap.org/current)
Try to make the weather report card descriptive and realistic (it's up to you how you use the response and populate the data)
This time focus on both functionality and the CSS part
